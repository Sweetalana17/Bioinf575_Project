rs3810651,GABRQ,venlafaxine,23394390,Efficacy,yes,Those with the AA/AT genotype are more likely to be responders. Please note; this is an A/T SNP and due to inconsistencies reported for other SNP alleles in the paper this should be kept in mind.,"Genotypes AA + AT are associated with increased response to venlafaxine in people with Depressive Disorder, Major as compared to genotype TT.",AA + AT,T
